# Slope-Stability-Dashboard
StabiTrack is an interactive Streamlit-based dashboard designed to visualize and analyze the stability of mine slopes using satellite-derived and geotechnical parameters. It integrates key indicators such as Factor of Safety (FoS), NDVI, Slope angle, and Rainfall to monitor slope behavior over time.
